# terminal-labyrinth
by Dmitrii 'sys466' Efimenko\
\
This project was inspired by olc’s command line fps.\
\
Basically, it’s a pseudo-3d game, fully written in Java. Use keyboard and mouse to navigate 5 labyrinths, while avoiding the hunters. Your goal is to collect 3 cards and to find an exit, all of which appear in random locations. Earphones are required as sound is your ally. And don’t hesitate as your time is slipping away. Good luck.\
\
The sounds were acquired at freesound.org:\
Horror Game Background Sound/Music by TheDweebMan\
M207b9_Screaming by Experimental Illness\
TFT04-E01-NoiseVoiceTones by Freed\
Static by JamGrif\
\
It was a lot of fun to develop it, so I hope you like it.\
\
With best regards,\
sys466.
