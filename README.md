# terminal-labyrinth

This project was inspired by olc’s command line fps. Basically, it’s a pseudo-3d game, fully written in Java. User keyboard and mouse to navigate 5 labyrinths, while avoiding hunters. Your goal is to collect 3 cards and to find exit, all of which appear in random locations. Earphones are required as sound is your ally. And don’t hesitate as your time is slipping away. Good luck. It was a lot of fun to develop it, so I hope you like it. With best regards, sys466.
